.Nm aard
.Nd modular action interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl v
.Op Ar option ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility facilitates the execution of arbitrary actions in X.
.Pp
Enabling the user to execute multiple functions (options) in series,
.Nm
provides a modular interface to action composition.
.Pp
The program uses an internal <buffer> to hold data. That <buffer> can read from,
or write to the X clipboard.
By default, the <buffer> is written to the X clipboard at succesful program exit.
.Pp
The options are provided as arguments.
Notably, every option can be destructive to the data in the <buffer>,
overwriting or modifying it. The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Print version information and exit program.
.It Ar -
Populate the <buffer> with data read from standard input.
.It Ar base64
Encode the data in the <buffer> to base64 and load that base64 data into the <buffer>.
.It Ar clean
Remove leading and trailing whitespace, and newline characters from the <buffer>.
.It Ar clear
Remove all data in the <buffer>.
.It Ar define
Fetch definition of the grammatical unit currently in the <buffer> from
an online source. By default, a pdf with the definition is created and opened,
and the filesystem path to that pdf is loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar edit
Edit the data in the <buffer> with a text editor. This requires
.Nm
to be called from a terminal.
.It Ar emoji
Select an emoji from a prompt, and load that emoji into the <buffer>.
.It Ar fetch
Select an entity from the filesystem, the
.Nm
log, or the users shell history. Load the selected entity into the <buffer>.
.It Ar file
Interpret the <buffer> data as a filesystem path, and load the content of that
file into the <buffer>.
.It Ar help
List all
.Nm
options and their explanations in a prompt, enabling the user to select one option.
That option is then executed.
.It Ar host
List contents of the system hosts file in a prompt, enabling the user to select one entry.
The ip of the selected entry is then loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar html
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as an URL, and request the html source from that URL.
That target source is then loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar htmlx
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as an URL, and request the html render from that URL.
That text render is then loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar image
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as a filesystem path, and open that path with an image viewer.
.It Ar light
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as an integer representing percent.
Set the X display backlight to that percent.
.It Ar log
Timestamp and append the data in the <buffer> to the
.Nm
log.
.It Ar media
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as a filesystem path, and open that path with a media player.
.It Ar option
Open a prompt, enabling the user to input
.Nm
options. Then execute
.Nm
with those options.
.It Ar paste
Write the data in the <buffer> to standard output.
.It Ar pdf
Create a pdf with the data in the <buffer>, then load the filesystem path to that
created pdf into the <buffer>.
Default behaviour is to open that pdf with a pdf viewer after creation.
.It Ar post
Open a prompt, enabling the user to input text. That text is then postfixed to the
data in the <buffer>.
.It Ar pre
Open a prompt, enabling the user to input text. That text is then prefixed to the
data in the <buffer>.
.It Ar qr
Create a QR code with the data in the <buffer> and save it as png,
then load the filesystem path to that created png file into the <buffer>.
Default behaviour is to open that png with an image viewer after creation.
.It Ar random
Fetch true random data from an online source. Load that data as an ASCII
encoded hexadecimal string into the <buffer>.
.It Ar report
Pass the data in the <buffer> to the reporting system.
.It Ar run
Open a prompt, enabling the user to input text. That text is then executed in a shell
as a command. The standard output, and standard error of that command, is then loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar select
Display the data in the <buffer> in a prompt, enabling the user to select one entry.
That entry is loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar set
Open a prompt, enabling the user to input text. That text is loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar tty
Open a terminal, as defined in the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Ar url
Run an URL isolation program with the data in the <buffer>, generating a list of the URL addresses found
in the <buffer>. Then list those URL's in a prompt, enabling the user to select one URL.
That URL is loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar word
Select a dictionary word from a prompt, and load it into the <buffer>.
.It Ar x
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as a command. That command is executed in a shell.
The operations standard output, and standard error, is be loaded into the <buffer>.
.It Ar yt
Interpret the data in the <buffer> as YouTube search terms, and request search results for those terms online.
Then list the returned results in a prompt, enabling the user to select one entity.
The URL to that entity is loaded into the <buffer>.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS

includes a reporting system for descriptive error messages,
and a simpler status reporting system for program state.
Example scripts are installed as aard_report and aard_status.
.Sh AUTHORS
Carl H. Henriksson <aard at martial dot cc>
.Sh CAVEATS
The aard_report and aard_status example scripts are destructive to the
X primary and secondary buffer; those systems should be disabled in
the configuration file if that behaviour is unwanted.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
.Nm
uses temporary files. Those files containing potentially sensitive
data may be left in the filesystem on program fail.
